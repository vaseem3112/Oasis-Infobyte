🧠 Project Overview

This project showcases AI-assisted data analysis using Prompt Engineering to design and execute a complete Data Science workflow.

Instead of writing all code manually, structured AI prompts were used to:

Generate Python scripts

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Create Data Visualizations

Build Machine Learning models

Optimize Forecasting performance

All AI-generated outputs were reviewed, validated, and refined manually.

🤖 Role of AI & Prompt Engineering

AI was used as a collaborative development assistant, not as a replacement for human reasoning.

🔹 Prompt Engineering Strategy

Designed goal-oriented prompts

Applied iterative refinement

Reviewed and corrected generated code

Interpreted results using domain knowledge

🔹 Example Prompt Types

EDA prompts – “Analyze unemployment trends and summary statistics.”

Visualization prompts – “Plot unemployment rate distribution.”

Modeling prompts – “Build a regression model to predict unemployment.”

Forecasting prompts – “Apply ensemble learning for improved accuracy.”

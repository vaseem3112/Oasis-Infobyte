TASK 1 : Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

   we will explore how to detect email spam using machine learning. Email spam refers to unsolicited and unwanted emails that are sent in bulk to a large number of recipients. By using machine learning algorithms, we can train a model to classify emails as either spam or not spam based on their content.

Task 2 :  Unemployment analysis using python 

   Analyzing unemployment using Python involves exploring and visualizing unemployment data to gain insights into trends, patterns, and factors affecting employment and joblessness. This process typically includes data cleaning, visualization with tools like matplotlib or seaborn, statistical analysis to calculate summary statistics and perform hypothesis testing, and potentially machine learning for forecasting and deeper insights. By conducting unemployment analysis, stakeholders can make informed decisions, understand economic conditions, and develop strategies for addressing unemployment challenges.
